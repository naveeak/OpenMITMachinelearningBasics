Study Question: What is green vector normal to the hyperplane? Specify it as a column vector
Have to look

Study Question: What change would you have to make to θ, θ0 if you wanted to
have the separating hyperplane in the same place, but to classify all the points labeled ’+’ in the diagram as negative and all the points labeled ’-’ in the diagram as
positive?

not sure but changing the sign of theta and theta0 ie -θ, -θ0 will have the line in same place and but can be wrong

Study Question: What do you think happens to En(h), where h is the hypothesis
returned by RANDOM-LINEAR-CLASSIFIER, as k is increased?

as k increses the the RANDOM-LINEAR-CLASSIFIER will settle to a minimum point .En(h) may not be small for all k(random h) but algo will give the random 

Study Question: What properties of  Dn  do you think will have an effect on  En(h) ?  

training data must not be skewd and overfitted 
not sure about posssible answer
